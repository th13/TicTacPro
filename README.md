# TicTacPro
A Java Tic Tac Toe game with AI and Variable Board Size

## Features
* Support for variable board size (currently, formatting of the board only works for `board_size <= 9`, but 
  the program theoretically supports any size that can fit in memory).
* Player v. Player game mode or Player v. Computer.
  * AI that simulates "real" human play by introducing some degree of randomness, defensive game play, and offensive game play (when it has a chance of winning).
